"snippet, the inputs are plain python integer types, which cannot be "

"In the previous section on :ref:`calculation "

"simple python function can be transformed into a process, such that when it "
"is launched, its execution is recorded automatically in the provenance "
"graph. However, not all computations are well suited to be implemented as a "
"python function, but rather are implemented as a separate code, external to "
"AiiDA. To interface an external code with the engine of AiiDA, the "
":py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.calcjobs.calcjob.CalcJob` process class "
"was introduced. A detailed explanation of how to implement it, the interface"
" and best practices, can be found in a :ref:`later "

"To illustrate how a calculation job operates, we need an external code. "

"this 'code' through AiiDA, you need to tell *how* AiiDA should run it. The "
":py:class:`~aiida.calculations.arithmetic.add.ArithmeticAddCalculation` is a"
" calculation job implementation that forms an interface to accomplish "
"exactly that for the example bash script. A ``CalcJob`` implementation for a"
" specific code, often referred to as a calculation plugin, essentially "
"instructs the engine how it should be run. This includes how the necessary "
"input files should be created based on the inputs that it receives, how the "
"code executable should be called and what files should be retrieved when the"
" calculation is complete. Note the files should be 'retrieved' because "

"To prevent the calculation job from excepting and it being lost forever, an "
"*exponential backoff mechanism* has been implemented. Whenever the engine "
"performs a transport task but encounters an exception, instead of letting "
"the calculation job fail, it will reschedule the same task to be executed "
"again at a later time. The task will be automatically rescheduled until it "
"finishes successfully, where the interval between tries increases "

"a script for example. But rather it indicates the creation of a new piece of"
" data from some other data through a computation implemented by a process. "
"This is then exactly what the calculation function does. It takes one or "
"more data nodes as inputs and returns one or more data nodes as outputs, "
"whose content is based on those inputs. As explained in the :ref:`technical "

"returning the nodes from the function. The engine will inspect the return "

"When deciding where to store a property of a data type, one has the option "

"that are stored in the database (such as the attributes), are directly "
"searchable as part of a database query, whereas data stored in the file "
"repository cannot be queried for. What this means is that, for example, it "
"is possible to search for all nodes where a particular database-stored "
"integer attribute falls into a certain value range, but the same value "
"stored in a file within the file repository would not be directly searchable"
" in this way. However, storing large amounts of data within the database "
"comes at the cost of slowing down database queries. Therefore, big data "
"(think large files), whose content does not necessarily need to be queried "
"for, is better stored in the file repository. A data type may safely use "
"both the database and file repository in parallel for individual properties."
" Properties stored in the database are stored as *attributes* of the node. "
"The node class has various methods to set these attributes, such as "

"*updatable* attributes is introduced. These are special attributes that are "
