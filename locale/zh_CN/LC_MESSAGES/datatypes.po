"In the first case two neighboring kpoints with ``X`` and ``Y`` labels will "

" assumes them to be a discontinuity point in the band structure (e.g. "
"Gamma-X|Y-U). In the second case the kpoints labelled ``X`` and ``Y`` are "
"not neighbors anymore, so they are plotted with a certain distance between "
