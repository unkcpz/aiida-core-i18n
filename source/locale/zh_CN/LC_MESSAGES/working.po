"It has been said many times before: calculation functions, like all "

"a script for example. But rather it indicates the creation of a new piece of"

"This is then exactly what the calculation function does. It takes one or "
"more data nodes as inputs and returns one or more data nodes as outputs, "
"whose content is based on those inputs. As explained in the :ref:`technical "
"section<working_process_functions>`, outputs are created simply by returning"

"the function and attach the output nodes to the calculation node that "
"represents the calculation function. To verify that the output nodes are in "

"Therefore, it is very important that you **do not store the nodes you create"

"前面曾多次提到: 算例函数，如同所有的“算例性”例程一样，能够  “创建” 数据，但所谓的“创建”具体指什么？ "
