"This simple code snippet will achieve the goal of getting the desired "

":py:meth:`~aiida.engine.processes.functions.calcfunction`. The "
"``calcfunction`` in AiiDA is a `function decorator "
"<https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-decorator>`_ that transforms a"
" regular python function in a calculation process, which automatically "

"with ``calcfunction`` decorators yields:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/source/concepts/calculations.rst:45
msgid ""
"The only thing we had to do to decorate the two functions was to add the "
"line ``@calcfunction`` just before the function definition. Adding the "
"decorator tells AiiDA that the provenance for this function should be stored"
" in the provenance graph when it is executed. This means linking up the "
"inputs and the outputs for a calculation node, which represents the function"
" that was executed. The final change that has to be performed to make this "
"possible, is to make the inputs and the outputs storable. In the previous "
"snippet, the inputs are plain python integer types, which cannot be "
"automatically stored in the provenance graph as nodes. To solve this, one "
"only has to wrap them in the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.int.Int` node "
"sub class, which makes them storable in the database:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/source/concepts/calculations.rst:55

"The only difference with the previous snippet is that all inputs have been "
"wrapped in the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.int.Int` class. The result "

"In the previous section on :ref:`calculation "
"functions<concepts_calcfunctions>`, we showed how a simple python function "
"can be transformed into a process, such that when it is launched, its "
"execution is recorded automatically in the provenance graph. However, not "
"all computations are well suited to be implemented as a python function, but"
" rather are implemented as a separate code, external to AiiDA. To interface "
"an external code with the engine of AiiDA, the "
":py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.calcjobs.calcjob.CalcJob` process class "
"was introduced. A detailed explanation of how to implement it, the interface"
" and best practices, can be found in a :ref:`later "
"section<working_calcjobs>`. Here, instead, we will focus on the big picture "
"and explain in broad lines how a calculation job models the execution of an "
"external code and what tasks it performs when launched."
msgstr ""

"To illustrate how a calculation job operates, we need an example external "
"code. Let's imagine an external code that consists of a bash script that "
"reads an input file containing two integers, sums them and echoes the "
"result, for example:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/source/concepts/calculations.rst:108
msgid ""
"When run, this script reads the content of a file called ``aiida.in`` and "
"expects that it contains two integers, that it will parse into the variables"
" ``x`` and ``y``, whose sum it will echo. When you want to run this 'code' "
"through AiiDA, you need to tell *how* AiiDA should run it. The "
":py:class:`~aiida.calculations.plugins.arithmetic.add.ArithmeticAddCalculation`"
" is a calculation job implementation that forms an interface to accomplish "
"exactly that for the example bash script. A ``CalcJob`` implementation for a"
" specific code, often referred to as a calculation plugin, essentially "
"instructs the engine how it should be run. This includes how the necessary "
"input files should be created based on the inputs that it receives, how the "
"code executable should be called and what files should be retrieved when the"
" calculation is complete. Note the files should be 'retrieved' because "
"calculation jobs can be run not just on the localhost, but on any "
":ref:`computer that is configured in AiiDA<setup_computer>`, including "
"remote machines accessible over for example SSH."

"The execution of the calculation job is represented in the provenance graph "

"nodes ``x`` and ``y`` that were passed as inputs are linked to the "
"calculation job as such, as well as the third input ``code``. This input is "
"required for *all* calculation jobs as it represents the external code that "
"is actually executed. These code nodes are instances of "
":py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.code.Code` class, which is a sub class of "
":py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.data.Data`, which means that code instances"

msgid ""
"In the case of calculation jobs being executed on a remote machine, the "
"engine will have to connect to the machine for each of the transport tasks. "
"In connecting to the remote, a whole host of potential problems may occur, "
"that would cause the calculation job to fail. For example, the remote "
"machine may be down and as a result unreachable, or the engine itself may "
"lose its internet connection. However, these problems are often temporary. "
"To prevent the calculation job from excepting and it being lost forever, an "
"'exponential backoff mechanism' has been implemented. Whenever the engine "
"performs a transport task but encounters an exception, instead of letting "
"the calculation job fail, it will reschedule the same task to be executed "
"again at a later time. The task will be automatically rescheduled until it "
"finishes successfully, where the interval between tries increases "
"exponentially. If after 5 consecutive tries, the task still fails, instead "
"of rescheduling it, the engine will simply pause the calculation job. The "
"output of ``verdi process list`` will give more information on why the task "
"failed:"
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/source/concepts/calculations.rst:186
msgid ""
"When there are calculation jobs that have been paused because the transport "
"tasks have failed multiple times, the user has the time to investigate the "
"problem. If the problem is determined to be temporary and it has been "
"resolved, one can use ``verdi process play`` to resume the paused processes."
" The engine will then automatically reschedule the task that failed last and"
" the calculation job will continue where it left off."
msgstr ""

#: ../docs/source/concepts/calculations.rst:190

"This exponential backoff mechanism makes the engine very robust with respect"

"configurable, but they might be in the future."

"The previous section explained how the ``CalcJob`` class functions as an "

"as mentioned before, those tasks stop after the output files have been "
"retrieved, which the engine will attach as an "
":py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.data.folder.FolderData` node with the label "
"``retrieved`` to the calculation job node. As far as the calculation job "
"goes, that is all that is absolutely required. However, often one wants to "
"parse those output files into some specific outputs that should be "
"represented as individual outputs nodes in the provenance graph. This can be"
" accomplished by implementing the :py:class:`~aiida.parsers.parser.Parser` "
"class and specifying it in the inputs of the calculation job. In that case, "
"the engine will call the parser after the output files created by the job "

"reflects the state of the process in memory. This means that the output of "

"calculation function, and store the sum temporarily in the "
":ref:`context<working_workchains_context>`. The next step in the outline, "
"``multiply``, will take the sum stored in the context that was computed in "
"the first outline step and call the ``multiply`` calculation function with "
"the third input integer. Finally, the ``result`` step will take the product "
"produced by the previous step and record it as an output of the work chain. "

"The work chain solution to the add-multiply problem, requires significantly "
"more code compared to the work function solution presented in the beginning "
"of this section. Why should one bother using the work chain then? The "
"advantages for this trivial example may be difficult to see, but imagine "
"that the logic of the workflow becomes more complicated and the calculations"
" become more intensive. The process specification of the work chain provides"
" a central way of defining the inputs and outputs, making it easy to see at "
"a glance how the work chain operates. In addition, the ``outline`` can give "
"a succinct summary of the logical steps that the work chain will perform, "
"all of which a work function does not have. The outline in this example was "
"trivially simple, but the :ref:`advanced work chain development "
"section<working_workchains>` will show how complex logic can be implemented "
"directly in the process specification. The process specification also makes "
"it easy to 'wrap' existing work chains into more complex work chains through"
" the :ref:`expose functionality<working_workchains_expose_inputs_outputs>`."

"Finally, as mentioned before, the work chain provides the possibility of "

" work chain is saved after each outline step. If expensive calculation jobs "
"are performed in an individual outline step, they will be saved as soon as "
"they finish. This is impossible for work functions and if it were to be "
"interrupted before *all* the computations had been completed, all "
"intermediate progress would be lost. The rule of thumb therefore is, as soon"
