#: ../docs/source/index.rst:27
msgid ""
"**Workflows:** Write complex, auto-documenting workflows in python, linked "
"to arbitrary executables on local and remote computers. The event-based "
"workflow engine supports tens of thousands of processes per hour with full "
"checkpointing."

"**Data provenance:** Automatically track inputs, outpus & metadata of all "
"calculations in a provenance graph for full reproducibility. Perform fast "
"queries on graphs containing millions of nodes."

#: ../docs/source/index.rst:29
msgid ""
"**HPC interface:** Move your calculations to a different computer by "
"changing one line of code. AiiDA is compatible with schedulers like `SLURM "
"<https://slurm.schedmd.com>`_, `PBS Pro <https://www.pbspro.org/>`_, `torque"
" <http://www.adaptivecomputing.com/products/torque/>`_, `SGE "
