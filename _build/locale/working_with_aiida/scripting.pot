msgid "It is not possible to run multiple times the ``load_dbenv()`` command. Since calling ``verdi run`` will automatically call the ``load_dbenv()`` command, you cannot run a script that contains this call (this is instead needed if you want to run the script simply via ``python scriptname.py``). If you want to allow for both options, use the following method to discover if the db environment was already loaded::"

msgid "Finally, we also defined a ``runaiida`` command, that simply will pass all its parameters to ``verdi run``. The reason for this is that one can define a new script to be run with ``verdi run``, add as the first line the shebang command ``#!/usr/bin/env runaiida``, and give to the file execution permissions, and the file will become an executable that is run using AiiDA.
