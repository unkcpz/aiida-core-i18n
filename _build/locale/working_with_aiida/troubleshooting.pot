msgid "For each profile that runs a daemon, there will be two unique logfiles, one for AiiDA log messages and one from the circus daemonizer. These files can be found in the ``.aiida`` log folder, which by default can be found at ``~/.aiida/daemon/log/aiida_daemon.log``. After rebooting the daemon (``verdi daemon restart``), the number of messages logged will increase significantly and may help in understanding the source of the problem."

msgid "The backup of the repository takes an extensively long time if it is done through a standard rsync or backup software, since it contains as many folders as the number of nodes (and each folder can contain many files!). A solution is to use instead the incremental backup described in the :ref:`repository backup section<repository_backup>`."

#: ../../source/working_with_aiida/troubleshooting.rst:67
msgid "Under typical Linux distributions, there is a cron job (called ``updatedb.mlocate``) running every day to update a database of files and folders -- this is to be used by the ``locate`` command. This might become problematic since the repository contains many folders and will be scanned everyday. The net effect is a hard drive almost constantly working."
