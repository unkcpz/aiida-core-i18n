Apart from the data schema, the AiiDA code and the export file version are also mentioned. This is used to avoid any incompatibilities among different versions of AiiDA. It should be noted that the schema described in metadata.json is related to the data itself - abstracted schema focused on the extracted information -  and not how the data is stored in the database (database schema). This makes the import/export mechanism to be transparent to the database system used, backend selected and how the data is organised in the database (database schema)."

msgid "Then in the *all_fields_info*, the properties of each entity are mentioned. It is also mentioned the correlations with other entities.

msgid "Then the export data follows where for every entity the data appear. It is worth observing the references between the instances of the various entities.

The field *node_attributes_conversion* contains information regarding the type of the attribute. For example the dates are not inherently supported by JSON, so it is specified explicitly in the schema if the value of an attribute is of that specific type. After the *node_attributes_conversion* the *node_attributes* section follows with the actual values."
