msgid "AiiDA is a sophisticated framework designed from scratch to be a flexible and scalable infrastructure for computational science. Being able to store the full data provenance of each simulation, and based on a tailored database solution built for efficient data mining implementations, AiiDA gives the user the ability to interact seamlessly with any number of HPC machines and codes thanks to its flexible plugin interface, together with a powerful workflow engine for the automation of simulations. The software is available at http://www.aiida.net."
