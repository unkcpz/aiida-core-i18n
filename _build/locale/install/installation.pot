msgid "AiiDA depends on a number of third party python packages, and usually on specific versions of those packages. In order not to interfere with third party packages needed by other software on your system, we *strongly* recommend isolating AiiDA in a `virtual python environment <https://docs.python.org/tutorial/venv.html>`_. In the following, we describe how to create a virtual python environment using the `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>`_ tool, but feel free to use your preferred environment manager (e.g. `conda <https://conda.io/docs/>`_)."
