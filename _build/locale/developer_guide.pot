In other words, when the API receives a GET (POST) request to the URL ``new-endpoint``, the function ``NewResource.get()`` (``NewResource.post()``) will be executed. The HTTP response is constructed around the data returned by these functions. The data, which are packed as dictionaries, are serialized by Flask as a JSON stream of data. All the Python built-in types can be serialized by Flask (e.g. ``int``, ``float``, ``str``, etc.), whereas for serialization of custom types we let you refer to the `Flask documentation <http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/>`_ .

Such an object must be able to be subsequently deserialized without changing value. If a simple datatype is passed (integer, float, etc.), a check is performed to see if it has a value of ``nan`` or ``inf``, as these cannot be stored. Otherwise, if a list, tuple, dictionary, etc., is  passed, this check is performed for each value it contains. This is done recursively, automatically handling the case of nested objects. It is important to note that iterable type objects are converted to lists during this process, and mappings, such as dictionaries, are converted to normal dictionaries. This cleaning process is used by default when setting node attributes via :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node.set_attribute` and :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node.append_to_attr`, although it can be disabled by setting ``clean=False``.

The data and calculations, produced and ran by AiiDA, were stored as nodes in a graph. Due to the causality principle, the resulting graph was naturally acyclic, as no piece of data could possibly be an input to its own creation. The directed acyclic graph that stored the data provenance in AiiDA was well defined and all was good."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/design/changes.rst:21

Workflows allow the user to define a sequence of calculations, that ultimately produce a result. In order to be able to retrieve the final result directly from the workflow, it needed to be able to return the data created by the calculations that it ran. \"Easy peasy: we simply add a ``return`` link from the workflow node in the graph to the created data node\". But wat seemed like an easy solution brought a host of unforeseen problems with it. By introducing the concept of a ``return`` link, the acyclicity of the graph was broken, and with it, much of AiiDA's graph traversal API that assumed this property."
msgstr ""

msgid "After more than a year of discussion, AiiDA developers and users concluded that the concept of the ``return`` link was absolutely crucial. Without them, for complicated and heavily nested workflows, their results will be buried deep within their call stack and difficult to retrieve. The alternative was to redesign the provenance graph architecture such that acyclicity would be returned to part of the provenance graph, while keeping the utility of the ``return`` link. The AiiDA development team, in close collaboration with advanced users, spent a year and a half, redesigning the provenance architecture and implementing the changes into AiiDA's API. As always, we have tried our best to allow early adopters of AiiDA to migrate their existing databases to newer versions as easy as possible, by providing automatic migration. This time around is no different, except for the fact that the migration was a lot more complicated and unfortunately this time some backwards-incompatible changes had to be introduced in the API."

#: ../../source/developer_guide/design/changes.rst:43
msgid "The calculation job has been one of the most used and important components of AiiDA as it represents a calculation that is submitted to a scheduler, often on a remote cluster. From its earliest conception, the class that implemented this feature, the ``JobCalculation``, fulfilled two major but very distinct tasks. On one side, it provided the means to the user to specify what inputs the calculation required, how the actual input files should be constructed, and what files should be retrieved after completion. In addition to that, since it was a sub class of the ``Node`` class, it also functioned as a record in the provenance graph of an actual calculation that was executed. This double role was leading to problems with the ``Node`` class becoming too complicated as well as inconsistent. For example, an instance representing an already completed calculation would also still have the methods on how to run it again."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/design/changes.rst:50
msgid "This problem was solved with the introduction of the ``WorkChain`` in ``aiida-core`` version ``0.7.0``. Like the ``JobCalculation``, the ``WorkChain`` was a process that takes certain inputs and then performs operations on those in order to produce outputs. However, unlike the ``JobCalculation``, the ``WorkChain`` class was only concerned with knowledge of *how* the process should be run. To represent the execution of the ``WorkChain`` in the provenance graph, a different class was used, namely the ``WorkChainNode``. This separation of responsibilities leads to two entities with a clearer interface and behavior."
msgstr ""

In ``aiida-core`` version ``1.0.0`` we fully deprecate the old way and all calculations now use the process/node duality. As a result the ``JobCalculation`` class has disappeared. Now, instead, a ``CalcJobNode`` is created in the provenance graph to represent the execution of a calculation through a scheduler. Moreover, to implement the plugin for a calculation job, one now subclasses the ``Process`` subclass ``CalcJob``, whose interface is the same as that of the ``WorkChain``."

This method takes a single argument ``folder`` which will point to a temporary folder to which the required input files for the calculation can be written. From a plugin developer standpoint, the rest works exactly as before, and the ``prepare_for_submission`` method should return a ``CalcInfo`` object, containing information for the engine on what files to copy over and to retrieve."

A plugin host like AiiDA can iterate through entry points by group, find a specific one by name and load the associated python object. Iterating and finding entry points does not require any python code to be imported.
