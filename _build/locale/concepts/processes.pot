msgid "Anything that runs in AiiDA is an instance of the :py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.process.Process` class. The ``Process`` class contains all the information and logic to tell, whoever is handling it, how to run it to completion. Typically the one responsible for running the processes is an instance of a :py:class:`~aiida.engine.runners.Runner`. This can be a local runner or one of the daemon runners in case of the daemon running the process."

msgid "In addition to those run instructions, any ``Process`` that has been executed needs some sort of record in the database to store what happened during its execution. For example it needs to record what its exact inputs were, the log messages that were reported and what the final outputs were. For this purpose, every process will utilize an instance of a sub class of the :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.process.ProcessNode` class. This ``ProcessNode`` class is a sub class of :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.Node` and serves as the record of the process' execution in the database and by extension the provenance graph."

msgid "It is very important to understand this division of labor. A ``Process`` describes how something should be run, and the ``ProcessNode`` serves as a mere record in the database of what actually happened during execution. A good thing to remember is that while it is running, we are dealing with the ``Process`` and when it is finished we interact with the ``ProcessNode``."

Again, this is a distinction that plays a big role in AiiDA and is crucial to understand. For this reason, these different types of processes also get a different sub class of the ``ProcessNode`` class. The hierarchy of these node classes and the link types that are allowed between them and ``Data`` nodes, is explained in detail in the :ref:`provenance implementation<concepts_provenance_implementation>` documentation."

As soon as it is picked up by a runner and it is active, it will be in the ``Running`` state. If the process is waiting for another process, that it called, to be finished, it will be in the ``Waiting`` state. A process that is in the ``Killed`` state, means that the user issued a command to kill it, or its parent process was killed. The ``Excepted`` state indicates that during execution an exception occurred that was not caught and the process was unexpectedly terminated. The final option is the ``Finished`` state, which means that the process was successfully executed, and the execution was nominal.

msgid "The previous section about the process state showed that a process that is ``Finished`` does not say anything about whether the result is 'successful' or 'failed'. The ``Finished`` state means nothing more than that the engine managed to run the process to the end of execution without it encountering exceptions or being killed. To distinguish between a 'successful' and 'failed' process, an 'exit status' can be defined. The `exit status is a common concept in programming <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exit_status>`_ and is a small integer, where zero means that the result of the process was successful, and a non-zero value indicates a failure. By default a process that terminates nominally will get a zero exit status. To mark a process as failed, one can return an instance of the :py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.exit_code.ExitCode` named tuple, which allows to set an integer ``exit_status`` and a string message as ``exit_message``. When the engine receives such an ``ExitCode`` as the return value from a process, it will set the exit status and message on the corresponding attributes of the process node representing the process in the provenance graph. How exit codes can be defined and returned depends on the process type and will be documented in detail in the respective :ref:`calculation<working_calculations>` and :ref:`workflow<working_workflows>` development sections."

#: ../../source/concepts/processes.rst:128
msgid "As explained in the :ref:`introduction of this section<concepts_processes>`, there is a clear and important distinction between the 'process' and the 'node' that represents its execution in the provenance graph. When a process is launched, an instance of the ``Process`` class is created in memory which will be propagated to completion by the responsible runner. This 'process' instance only exists in the memory of the python interpreter that it is running in, for example that of a daemon runner, and so we cannot directly inspect its state. That is why the process will write any of its state changes to the corresponding node representing it in the provenance graph. In this way, the node acts as a 'proxy' or a mirror image that reflects the state of the process in memory. This means that the output of many of the ``verdi`` commands, such as ``verdi process list``, do not actually show the state of the process instances, but rather the state of the node to which they have last written their state."

msgid "Process tasks"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/processes.rst:137
msgid "The previous section explained how launching a process means creating an instance of the ``Process`` class in memory. When the process is being 'ran' (see the section on :ref:`launching processes<working_processes_launch>` for more details), that is to say in a local interpreter, that process instance will die as soon as the interpreter dies. This is what makes 'submitting' a process, often times the preferred launching method. When a process is 'submitted', an instance of the ``Process`` is created, along with the node that represents it in the database, and its state is then persisted to the database. This is called a 'process checkpoint', more information on which :ref:`will follow later<concepts_process_checkpoints>`. Subsequently, the process instance is shutdown and a 'continuation task' is sent to the process queue of RabbitMQ. This task is simply a small message that just contains an identifier for the process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/processes.rst:145
msgid "All the daemon runners, when they are launched, subscribe to the process queue and RabbitMQ will distribute the continuation tasks to them as they come in, making sure that each task is only sent to one runner at a time. The receiving daemon runner can restore the process instance in memory from the checkpoint that was stored in the database and continue the execution. As soon as the process reaches a terminal state, the daemon worker will acknowledge to RabbitMQ that the task has been completed. Until the runner has confirmed that a task is completed, RabbitMQ will consider the task as incomplete. If a daemon runner is shutdown or dies before it got the chance to finish running a process, the task will automatically be requeued by RabbitMQ and sent to another. Together with the fact that all the tasks in the process queue are persisted to disk by RabbitMQ, guarantees that once a continuation task has been sent to RabbitMQ, it will at some point be finished, while allowing the machine to be shutdown."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/processes.rst:152
msgid "Each daemon runner has a maximum number of tasks that it can run concurrently, which means that if there are more active tasks than available slots, some of the tasks will remain queued. Processes whose task is in the queue and not with any runner, though technically 'active' as it is not terminated, it is not actually being run at the moment. While a process is not actually being run, i.e. it is not in memory with a runner, one also cannot interact with it. Similarly, as soon as the task disappears, either because the process was intentionally terminated, or unintentionally due to a bug or problem, the process will never continue running again."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/processes.rst:162
msgid "A process checkpoint is a complete representation of a ``Process`` instance in memory that can be stored in the database. Since it is a complete representation, the ``Process`` instance can also be fully reconstructed from such a checkpoint. At any state transition of a process, a checkpoint will be created, by serializing the process instance and storing it as an attribute on the corresponding process node. This mechanism is the final cog in the machine, together with the persisted process queue of RabbitMQ as explained in the previous section, that allows processes to continue after the machine they were running on, has been shutdown and restarted."
