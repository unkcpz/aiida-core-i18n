msgid "The two most important concepts in AiiDA are **data** and **processes**. The former are pieces of data, such as a simple integer or float, all the way to more complex data concepts such as a dictionary of parameters, a folder of files or a crystal structure. Processes operate on this data in order to produce new data."

Workflows have data inputs, but cannot generate new data. They can only return data that is already in the database (one typical case is to return data created by a calculation they called)."

msgid "AiiDA automatically stores entities in its database and links them forming a **directed graph**. This directed graph automatically tracks the **provenance** of all data produced by calculations or returned by workflows. By tracking the provenance in this way, one can always fully retrace how a particular piece of data came into existence, thus ensuring its reproducibility."
msgstr ""

msgid "In particular, we define two types of provenance:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/provenance.rst:42
msgid "The **data provenance**, consisting of the part of the graph that *only* consists of data and calculations (i.e. without considering workflows), and only the **input** and **create** links that connect them. The data provenance records the full history of how data has been generated. Due to the causality principle, the data provenance part of the graph is a **directed acyclic graph** (DAG), i.e. its nodes are connected by directed edges and it does not contain any cycles."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/provenance.rst:43
msgid "The **logical provenance** which consists of workflow and data nodes, together with the **input**, **return** and **call** links that connect them. The logical provenance is *not* acyclic, e.g. a workflow that acts as a filter can return one of its own inputs, directly introducing a cycle."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/provenance.rst:45
msgid "The data provenance is essentially a log of which calculation generated what data using certain inputs. The data provenance alone already guarantees reproducibility (one could run again one by one the calculations with the provided input and would obtain the same outputs). The logical provenance gives additional information on why a specific calculation was run. Imagine the case in which you start from 100 structures, you have a filter operation that picks one, and then you run a simulation on it. The data provenance only shows the simulation you run on the structure that was picked, while the logical provenance can also show that the specific structure was not picked at random but via a specific workflow logic."

msgid "The hierarchy of the ORM classes for the process nodes. Only instances of the lowest level of classes will actually enter into the provenance graph.

msgstr ""

msgid "For what concerns data nodes, the base class (``Data``) is subclassed to provide functionalities specific to the data type and python methods to operate on it. Often, the name of the subclass contains the word “Data” appended to it, but this is not a requirement. A few examples:"

The calculation *creates* a new **data node** (D\\ :sub:`2`\\) that is also *returned* by the **workflow node**."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/provenance.rst:112
msgid "Notice that the different style and names for the two links coming into D\\ :sub:`2` is intentional, because it was the calculation that *created* the new data, whereas the workflow merely *returned* it. This subtle distinction has big consequences. By allowing workflow processes to *return* data, it can also *return* data that was among its inputs."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/provenance.rst:121
msgid "A scenario like this, represented in :numref:`fig_provenance_cycle`, would create a cycle in the provenance graph, breaking the “acyclicity” of the DAG. To restore the directed acyclic graph, we separate the entire provenance graph into two planes: the **creation provenance** and the **logical provenance**. All calculation processes inhabit the creation plane and can only have *create* links to the data they produce, whereas the workflow processes in the logical plane can only have *return* links to data. With this provision, the acyclicity of the graph is restored in the creation plane."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/concepts/provenance.rst:126
msgid "An additional benefit of thinking of the provenance graph in these two layers, is that it allows you to inspect it with different layers of granularity.
