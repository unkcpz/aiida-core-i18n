msgid "Once you have at least one computer configured, you can configure the codes. In AiiDA, for full reproducibility of each calculation, we store each code in the database, and attach to each calculation a given code. This has the further advantage to make very easy to query for all calculations that were run with a given code (for instance because I am looking for phonon calculations, or because I discovered that a specific version had a bug and I want to rerun the calculations)."

#: ../../source/get_started/codes.rst:20
msgid "With remote codes we denote codes that are installed/compiled on the remote computer. Indeed, this is very often the case for codes installed in supercomputers for high-performance computing applications, because the code is typically installed and optimized on the supercomputer."

msgid "**default input plugin**: A string that identifies the default input plugin to be used to generate new calculations to use with this code. This string has to be a valid string recognized by the ``CalculationFactory`` function. To get the list of all available Calculation plugin strings, use the ``verdi calculation plugins`` command. Note: if you do not want to specify a default input plugin, you can write the string \"None\", but this is strongly discouraged, because then you will not be able to use the ``.get_builder`` method of the ``Code`` object."

However, in the present AiiDA version you cannot add attributes from the command line using ``verdi``, but you have to do it using Python code."
