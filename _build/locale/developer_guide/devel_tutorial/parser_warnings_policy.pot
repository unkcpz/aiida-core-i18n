msgid "As a rule of thumb, always include two keys in the output parameters of a calculation, ``warnings`` and ``parser_warnings``. These two keys contain a list of messages (strings) that are useful for debugging problems in the execution of calculations. Below are the guidelines for the usage of the keys ``warnings`` and ``parser_warnings`` in the output parameters of a calculation."

In the above cases the warning messages are directly copied from the output of the code, but a warning can also be elaborated by the parser when it finds out that something strange went on during the execution of the code. For QE an example is ``QE pw run did not reach the end of the execution.``"

msgid "Among the code-based warnings, some can be identified as ''critical'', meaning that when present the calculation should be set in ``FAILED`` state. There should be an internal list in the parser, e.g. ``critical_messages``, defining such critical warnings. Other non-critical warnings instead might be used to signal the presence of some possible source of troubles, but that nevertheless did not prevent the calculation to be considered ``FINISHED``."
