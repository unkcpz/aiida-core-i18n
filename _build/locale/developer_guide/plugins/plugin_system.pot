msgid "The plugin system is the part of AiiDA that enables sharing workflows and distributing extensions to the core capabilities of AiiDA."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:11
msgid "Since both are written in python and shared as source code, we believe they should be distributed in the usual way for python code - python packages using `setuptools`_. This provides a well documented install process familiar to all python users. It simplifies the user experience for sharing workflows and extensions, especially since this allows AiiDA to be distributed and deployed in the same way."

msgid "Decouple development and update cycles of AiiDA and plugins"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:31
msgid "Since plugins are separate python packages, they can be developed in a separate code repository and updated when the developer sees fit without a need to update AiiDA. Similarly, if AiiDA is updated, plugins may not need to release a new version."

msgid "Promote modular design in AiiDA development"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:36
msgid "Separating plugins into their own python packages ensures that plugins can not (easily) access parts of the AiiDA code which are not part of the public API, enabling AiiDA development to stay agile. The same applies to plugins relying on other plugins."

msgid "Automatic AiiDA setup and testing of plugins"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:46
msgid "Installation of complete python environments consisting of many packages can be automated, provided all packages use ``setuptools`` as a distribution tool. This enables use of AiiDA in a service-based way using, e.g., docker images. At the same it becomes possible to create automated tests for any combination of plugins, as long as the plugins provide test entry points."

msgid "Mechanism overview"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:53
msgid "The new plugin system (introduced in AiiDA 0.9) takes advantage of the already well established entry points mechanism within `setuptools`_, documented in the section \"`Extensible Applications and Frameworks`_\" in the ``setuptools`` documentation. (Previously, plugins had to install python modules directly into specific source folders of AiiDA)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:57
msgid "Conceptually, an entry point consists of a group name, an entry point name and a path to the definition of a python object (any object, including modules, classes, functions, variables). A plugin host like AiiDA can iterate through entry points by group, find a specific one by name and load the associated python object. Iterating and finding entry points does not require any python code to be imported. A plugin is a separately-distributed, self-contained python package which implements any number of plugin classes and declares entry points accordingly."

msgid "Note that the plugin developer can freely choose the code structure as well as the names of the modules and plugin classes. The developer is also free to refactor his code without fear of breaking compatibility, as long as no information stored in the database is changed (note that this unfortunately includes entry point name and class name)."

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:116
msgid "The chosen approach to plugins has some limitations:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:118
msgid "In the current version the interface for entry point objects is enforced implicitly by the way the object is used. It is the responsibility of the plugin developer to test for compliance, especially if the object is not derived from the recommended base classes provided by AiiDA. This is to be clearly communicated in the documentation for plugin developers;"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:119
msgid "The freedom of the plugin developer to name and rename classes ends where the information in question is stored in the database as, e.g., node attributes."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:120
msgid "The system is designed with the possibility of plugin versioning in mind, however this is not implemented yet."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:121
msgid "In principle, two different plugins can give the same name to an entry point, creating ambiguity when trying to load the associated objects. Plugin development guidelines in the documentation will advise on how to avoid this problem, and this is addressed via the use of a centralized registry of known AiiDA plugins."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/plugin_system.rst:122
msgid "Plugins can potentially contain malicious or otherwise dangerous code. In the registry of AiiDA plugins, we try to flag plugins that we know are safe to be used."
