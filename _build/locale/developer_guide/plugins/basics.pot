msgid "An AiiDA plugin is a `python package <packages>`_ that provides a set of extensions to AiiDA."

#: ../../source/developer_guide/plugins/basics.rst:11
msgid "AiiDA plugins can use :ref:`entry points <plugins.entry_points>` in order to make the ``aiida_core`` package aware of the extensions."

msgid "**Expose the full functionality.** Don't artificially limit the power of a code you are wrapping - or your users will get frustrated. If the code can do it, there should be *some* way to do it with your plugin."
