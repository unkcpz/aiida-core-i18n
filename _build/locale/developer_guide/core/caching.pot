msgid "The ``_cachable`` property is set to ``False`` in the :class:`aiida.orm.nodes.process.ProcessNode`, and only re-enabled in :class:`aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcjob.CalcJobNode` and :class:`CalcFunctionNode <aiida.orm.nodes.process.calculation.calcfunction.CalcFunctionNode>`. This means that a ``WorkflowNode`` will not be cached."

#: ../../source/developer_guide/core/caching.rst:12
msgid "The ``_store_from_cache`` method, which is used to \"clone\" an existing node, will raise an error if the existing node has any ``RETURN`` links. This extra safe-guard prevents cases where a user might incorrectly override the ``_cachable`` property on a ``WorkflowNode`` subclass."
