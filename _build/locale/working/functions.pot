This section will provide detailed information and best practices on how to implement these two process types. Since the calculation function and work function are both process functions and have the same implementation, all the rules explained below apply to both process types."

msgid "This chapter assumes that the basic concept and difference between calculation functions and work functions is known and when one should use on or the other. It is therefore crucial that, before you continue, you have read and understood the basic concept of :ref:`calculation functions<concepts_calcfunctions>` and :ref:`work functions<concepts_workfunctions>`."

msgid "The simple example in the :ref:`introductory section on calculation functions<concepts_calcfunctions>` showed how a simple python function can be turned into a calculation function simply by adorning it with the :py:func:`~aiida.engine.processes.functions.calcfunction` decorator. When the function is run, AiiDA will dynamically generate a :py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.functions.FunctionProcess` and build its :ref:`process specification<working_processes_spec>` based on the function signature. Here we will explain how this is accomplished and what features of the python function signature standard are supported."

msgid "Consider the following code snippet that defines a simple python function:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:38
msgid "The function takes three 'parameters', named ``x``, ``y`` and ``z``. In addition, the function ``plain_function`` is said to have default values, because one or more parameters (``z`` in this case) have the form `parameter = expression`. When *calling* a function, the terminology changes slightly and values for parameters can be passed as either 'positional' or 'keyword'. In the example below, the function is called with 'positional' arguments:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:46
msgid "They are called positional, because the arguments are not explicitly named and so will be matched to the corresponding parameter solely based on their position in the function call. In this example, ``x``, ``y`` and ``z`` will have the values ``1``, ``2`` and ``3``, respectively. Since we specified three values, the default for the third parameter ``z`` was not actually used. However, we are allowed to only specify two arguments, in which case the default *will* be used as can be seen below:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:54
msgid "By not specifying the third argument, the default will be used, so in this case ``z`` will equal ``1``. Additionally, one can employ 'named' arguments to specifically target a parameter based on its name, instead of having to rely on its position:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:60
msgid "Notice how the order in which we pass the arguments is irrelevant because we specify the name of each argument explicitly when assigning the value. Now that we know the difference between positional and named arguments, it is important to realize a python requirement that **positional arguments have to come before named arguments**. What this means is that *both* the function definition and function call below are illegal, because there are named arguments before positional ones:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:67
msgid "Finally, python knows the concept of ``*args`` and ``**kwargs``, also referred to as variable arguments and keyword arguments, which allow one to define a function which accepts an undetermined number of positional and keyword arguments."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:72
msgid "The variable arguments ``*args`` will receive the positionally passed arguments as a tuple and the keyword arguments ``**kwargs`` will receive the named arguments as a dictionary. With the formal definitions out of the way, let's now see which of these concepts are supported by process functions."

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:77
msgid "Default arguments are supported by calculation functions just as normal python functions as long as it is a :py:class:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node` instance, just like the inputs or ``None``. However, just as with python functions, one should only use immutable objects as function defaults because mutable objects can give unexpected results as they will be kept between function calls. Therefore, in order to use a default value for process functions, simply use ``None`` as the default value and check for its presence in the function body settings the default value if it is ``None``. This pattern looks like the following:"

msgid "Variable and keyword arguments"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:89
msgid "Variable arguments are *not* supported by process functions. The reasoning behind this is that the process specification for the :py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.functions.FunctionProcess` is built dynamically based on the function signature and so the names of the inputs are based on the parameter name from the function definition, or the named argument when the function is called. Since for variable arguments, neither at function definition nor at function call, explicit parameter names are used, the engine can impossibly determine what names, and by extensions link label, to use for the inputs."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:93
msgid "In contrast, keyword arguments for that reason *are* supported and it is the keyword used when the function is called that determines the names of the parameters and the labels of the input links.

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:106
msgid "Note that the inputs **have to be passed as keyword arguments** because they are used for the link labels. If the inputs would simply have been passed as positional arguments, the engine could have impossibly determined what label to use for the links that connect the input nodes with the calculation function node. For this reason, invoking a 'dynamic' function, i.e. one that supports ``**kwargs`` in its signature, with more positional arguments that explicitly named in the signature, will raise a ``TypeError``."

This is the default link label if only a single result is returned from the calculation function. If you want to specify a label yourself, you can return the result in the form of a dictionary, where the key will be used as the link label. By using a dictionary you can also record multiple nodes as output. Consider the following snippet:"

msgid "It is very important that you **do not call** :py:meth:`~aiida.orm.nodes.node.Node.store` **yourself** on the nodes before returning them from a ``calcfunction``. Because of the calculation/workflow duality in AiiDA, a ``calcfunction``, which is a calculation-like process, can only *create* and not *return* data nodes. This means that if a node is returned from a ``calcfunction`` that *is already stored*, the engine will throw an exception."

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:138
msgid "So far we have only seen examples of calculation functions where everything works out just fine. However, the real world is different, and often we will encounter situations where problems arise. A calculation function may receive incorrect or incoherent inputs, or the code it executes may throw an exception. Of course we could throw an input validation exception or not even catch the exceptions that the code we call throws, but that will lead the function process to be put in the ``Excepted`` terminal state. As explained in the :ref:`process state<concepts_process_state>` section, this state is indeed reserved for processes that incurred an exception during execution. Consider the following calculation function definition and call:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:148
msgid "Because the value for ``y`` that is being passed is zero, the engine will encounter a ``ZeroDivisionError`` exception when the calculation function is run. The output of ``verdi process list`` will confirm that the process has excepted:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:159
msgid "Exceptions that occur during the execution of a process are recorded as a log message on the corresponding process node. To show these log messages, one can use ``verdi process report``. In the case of the example above, it would look something like the following:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:178
msgid "However, in this particular example the exception is not so much an unexpected error, but one we could have considered and have seen coming, so it might be more applicable to simply mark the process as failed. To accomplish this, there is the concept of an :ref:`exit status<concepts_process_exit_codes>` that can be set on the process, which is an integer that, when non-zero, marks a process in the ``Finished`` state as 'failed'. Since the exit status is set as an attribute on the process node, it also makes it very easy to query for failed processes. To set a non-zero exit status on a calculation function to indicate it as failed, simply return an instance of the :py:class:`~aiida.engine.processes.exit_code.ExitCode` named tuple. Time for a demonstration:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:187
msgid "When we run the calculation function now, with the same inputs, instead of excepting, the process will successfully terminate and its exit status will be set to the value stored in the ``ExitCode``. The exit status is also displayed by ``verdi process list``:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:199
msgid "Both approaches are valid and which one to use depends on your use case. The question you should ask yourself is whether a potential problem merits throwing the process on the pile of 'excepted' processes. Or maybe, as in the example above, the problem is easily foreseeable and classifiable with a well defined exit status, in which case it might make more sense to return the exit code. At the end one should think which solution makes it easier for a workflow calling the function to respond based on the result and what makes it easier to query for these specific failure modes."

Note, however, that just storing the source file of the function does not guarantee that one can reproduce the exact result. For example, one can 'leak' data into the function by reading a file or loading an existing node from the database that was not explicitly passed as an input. Alternatively, external code can be imported and called, the source code of which will not be recorded."

Even if you store the source code, if you don't possess the file that was read, it is impossible to reproduce the results. Likewise, you should not load any existing data from the database through the API, but rather they should be direct inputs of the process function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:240
msgid "A similar problem occurs when importing other python code. Practically, it is almost impossible to never import code into process functions, as this would force massive code duplication. However, there is still a difference between importing code from the ``aiida-core`` library or the repository in which the process function is hosted, and the importing of a local python file. Even though for both cases there can no be guarantee of reproducibility, the former stands a better chance by far, as the version number of the plugin should be recorded. The rule of thumb then is to keep the importing of code to a minimum, but if you have to, make sure to make it part of a plugin package with a well-defined version number."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/working/functions.rst:246
msgid "Finally, as mentioned in the introduction, the source file of a process function is stored as a file in the repository for *each execution*. Currently there is no automatic deduplication for identical files by the engine, so these files may occupy quite a bit of space. For this reason it is advisable to keep each process function in its own separate file. This not only improves readability, but it also minimizes the impact on the size of the file repository."
