msgid "As you might have seen in the previous ``PWscf`` tutorial, the procedure of attaching a pseudopotential file to each atomic species could be a bit tedious. In many situations, you will not produce a different pseudopotential file for every calculation you do. More likely, when you start a project you will stick to a pseudopotential file for as long as possible. Moreover, in a high-throughput calculation, you will like to do calculation over several elements keeping the same functional. That's also part of the reason why there are several projects (like `PSLibrary <http://qe-forge.org/gf/project/pslibrary/frs/>`_ or `GBRV <http://www.physics.rutgers.edu/gbrv/>`_ to name a few), that intend to develop a set of pseudopotentials that covers most of the periodic table for different functionals."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/pseudo_tutorial.rst:8
msgid "That's why we added the *pseudopotential families*. Each family is a set of pseudopotentials that are grouped together in a special type of `AiiDA Group of nodes`. Within each family, at most one pseudopotential can be present for a given chemical element."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/pseudo_tutorial.rst:10
msgid "Of course, a pseudopotential family does not have to completely cover the periodic table (also because such pseudopotential sets do not exist). This means that you can create a pseudopotential family containing only the pseudopotentials for a few elements that you are interested in."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/examples/pseudo_tutorial.rst:13
msgid "In principle, you can group different kinds of pseudopotentials into the same family. It is your responsibility to group only those with the same type, or obtained using the same functionals, approximations and / or levels of theory."

msgid "In the following, we will go through creating a pseudopotential family. First, you need to collect the pseudopotential files which should go into the family in a single folder -- we'll call it ``path/to/folder``. You can then add the family to the AiiDA database with ``verdi``::"

msgid "If the a pseudopotential family with the same ``name_of_the_family`` exists already, the pseudopotentials in the folder will be added to the existing group. The code will raise an error if you try to add two (different) pseudopotentials for the same element."

You can use the optional flag ``--stop-if-existing`` to instead abort (without changing anything in the database) if an existing pseudopotential is found."

#: ../../source/examples/pseudo_tutorial.rst:69
msgid "In this simple example, we expect the pseudopotentials to be in the same folder of the script. Then, we loop over the filenames and add them to the AiiDA database. The ``get_or_create`` method checks if the pseudopotential is already in the database and either stores it, or just returns the node already present in the database. The second value returned is a boolean and tells us if the pseudopotential was already present or not. We also store the returned nodes in a list (``pseudos_to_use``)."
